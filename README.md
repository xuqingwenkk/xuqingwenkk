### About Me 👋

I received my bachelor degree with Information Engineering from Southeast University in June, 2015. Then I am pursuing my PhD degree at ShanghaiTech University & China Academic of Science from Sep, 2015 and expected to graduate in July, 2021. My research interests include visual slam, omnidirectional vision and mobile robots. Recently, my research topic is extended Fourier-Mellin transform. Fourier-Mellin transform is an image registration algorithm, which is more robust than the feature based methods but limited to the planar and equidistant scenarios. I am extending it into multi-depth environments.
